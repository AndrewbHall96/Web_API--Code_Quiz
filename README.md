# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

For unit 4, we were tasked to create timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. Sticking with the theme of coding, my quiz asks the user a series of code related questions. If the user gets a question right, 10 seconds are added to the timer. If the user gets the question wrong, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. The time remaining at the end of the quiz equates to the users final score :-)

## Acceptance Criteria
-Start button that triggers a timer

-Cascading questions

-Save initials and score
